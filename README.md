BoneCP
======

BoneCP is a Java JDBC connection pool implementation that is tuned for high performance by minimizing lock contention to give greater throughput for your applications. It beats older connection pools such as C3P0 and DBCP but should now be considered deprecated in favour of HikariCP.
